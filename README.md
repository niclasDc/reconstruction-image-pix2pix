# Reconstruction FIB-SEM Images

## About The Project

FIB-SEM is an advanced method for capturing structures at the nano-scale for the study of component materials, but in the acquisition process of the images these generate artifact that distort your quality, including curtains.

To resolve these problems, we adapted a generative model that help in to remove this curtains artifact and generate a performance quality better image.

The implementation, the model can be found:
